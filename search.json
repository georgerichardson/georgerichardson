It contains information about myself and my work, a blog and other bits and pieces that might interest you, depending on what you’re into.\nFor the last few years, I’ve worked as a data scientist or a leader of data science and engineering teams, creating research and applications with social impact aims. I’ve also run various other projects, such as a DIY bike workshop and a community garden.\nI’m interested in the intersections of science and technology, ecological and social issues, strategy and left/socialist politics. Though I would class myself as an expert in none of those things.\nYou can also find me on X/Twitter, GitHub and LinkedIn.\nThis website is made with Quarto."

    "text": "This is a new place for me to blog. I plan to write about science and technology, left-wing politics and reflections about life.\nCreating this blog is a bit of a challenge to myself. I spend a lot of time thinking and not enough time bringing coherence to those thoughts or sharing them through writing. I want to change that for myself and for others who might find what I have to say useful.\nI occasionally post on Twitter (currently known as X) but find I’m not great at condensing what I want to say enough to fit the format well. I’ll still post on there occasionally and tag people who I mention here, but I’d rather stick mostly to long-form for now.\nI hope you will find something you enjoy or can make use of here."
